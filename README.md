**Machine Learning for Flower Classification
(IRIS Dataset)**

project is about developing a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica — using the well-known Iris dataset. The dataset contains 150 records with four key features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, which are used to determine the species of the flower.

The main purpose of this project is classification, where different supervised learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are applied to build predictive models. The expected outcome of the project is to accurately predict the species of an iris flower based on its feature measurements and to compare the performance of different algorithms. The project demonstrates the fundamental process of data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation, providing a practical understanding of machine learning classification techniques.

**Introduction**

**Brief background:**

**Importance and real-world relevance:**

The Iris Classification project demonstrates how machine learning algorithms can be applied to classify data based on feature patterns. It serves as an ideal starting point for beginners to understand supervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. Although simple, the methods and concepts used here are foundational for developing more complex classification systems used in healthcare, agriculture, and image-based recognition tasks.

**Motivation:**

The motivation behind this project is to gain practical experience in applying different machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to a well-known dataset and analyze their performance. This helps in building a deeper understanding of how models learn patterns and make predictions effectively.

The field of data science and artificial intelligence has grown rapidly, and classification problems are at the core of many real-world applications such as image recognition, medical diagnosis, and pattern detection. One of the most widely used datasets for understanding classification techniques is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of iris flowers belonging to three species — Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. These flowers are described by four numerical features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
